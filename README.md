# SystemVerilog-Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of small SystemVerilog modules and testbenches I created while learning the language.  
They are not meant to form a complete design, but rather serve as experiments and practice with various language features.

## Contents
- **Basic modules** – simple combinational and sequential logic examples
- **Testbenches** – small test environments to verify functionality
- **Syntax experiments** – code snippets exploring different SystemVerilog constructs

## Notes
- These files were written as part of my personal learning process and may not follow strict coding guidelines.
- Some modules are incomplete or purely illustrative.
- Feel free to use or adapt them for your own learning.
